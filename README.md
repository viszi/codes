Welcome in my Microsoft Excel related project repo, where I am sharing some stuffs which can be useful or interesting for you.

Most of the codes here are inspired by [The CodingTrain Youtube channel] (https://www.youtube.com/thecodingtrain/), which is a really good starting point to make programming interesting in funny and easy to understand way.

Other codes were created to make my work easier.
