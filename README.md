Welcome in my not just Microsoft Excel related, but Oracle EBS and SAP project repo, where I am sharing some stuffs which can be useful or interesting for you.

I am not an IT Professional, I have no such degree, but because I am working on daily basis with IT systems (mostly ERPs) I had to learn many things to make my and my boss's life easier.

Most of the codes here for Excel are inspired by [The CodingTrain Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/thecodingtrain/), which is a really good starting point to make programming interesting in funny and easy to understand way.

Other codes were created to make my work easier. 

If you are interested in Excel learning, then I could suggest the following English resources:
* ExcelIsFun on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/user/ExcelIsFun/videos)
* MrExcel on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/user/bjele123/videos)
* MrExcel Forum (https://www.mrexcel.com/forum/index.php)

Oracle EBS and SAP are ERPs (electonic resource planning systems) used by companies. I had the chance to work with many SAP versions (R2, R3 4.3, 4.6, ECC 6.0) and in case of Oracle R11 and R12.
