[https://www.codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/) is a great place to improve your programming skills. 
You can solve various issues on many programming languages and can see the solutions of others, which will help to learn new ways of the usage of the language.

Problems are categorized in different ways on Codewars, but the most obvious is the difficulty level - which is called kyu and dan. 

The smaller the KYU number the problem is harder.

* 8 and 7 kyus are for beginners
* 6 and 5 for novice users
* all others for experienced users

On YouTube you can find many streamers for solving problems available in Codewars. 
My current favorite is [CJ's (Coding Garden) playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM_i0obccy3sZGzZdpEtxPcR1iPIV0taQ).
