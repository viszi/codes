[SAP](https://www.sap.com/index.html) is complex product used by many business around the globe to handle critical data for the business. 
Sometimes you have to fetch/upload/update too many data, but the standard solutions will not work for you due to the customization of your organization.

If you are lucky and scripting is allowed you can interact with the frontend, and you don't have to beg to your IT department to develop the tool for your needs.
SAP GUI contains a scripting tool which can be used to record and playback your own scripts.

- For beginners I suggest this [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPPhA14Pm-8&list=PLk9erb9HGsPh28DftWcP8BIXmBtu2wnsL).
- Scripting Tracker from Stefan Schnell was a good tool to see different objects in SAP sessions.

I have uploaded here some scripts which were usefull in my work (mostly I had to work with MM module - vendors, purchase information records, purchase orders).

Beside SAP scripting even you can manipulate SAP data with any dataload tool (e.g. [JD Stuart's DataLoad](http://www.dataload.com/) is a good one).
