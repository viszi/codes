Here you can find some end-user tools what I have used in [Oracle E-Business Suite](https://www.oracle.com/applications/ebusiness/), which is an electronic resource planning system with multiple modules.
The given codes are compatible with Release 12 (I used them on 12.2.2) and does not require special authorization (no DBA admin, no developer role).

The Excel macros are calling the fronted forms to make changes on multiple records one-by-one.
The SQLs can be used to get data out of the system.

I highly recommend a dataload tool (e.g. [JD Stuart's DataLoad](http://www.dataload.com/)) for the repetitive tasks.
