You can find here some queries used by me in Oracle EBS R12.

They are not perfect, but do the trick for most of the cases.

1. Purchase Orders.sql lists most important information about a purchase order (ordered items, quantities, prices, dates, vendors)
2. Purchase Requisitions.sql lists details of requests.
3. Suppliers.sql and Suppliers_with_bank_data.sql try to show registered vendors data.


## Usage

- You should have database access to Oracle EBS
- You need a configured program which can execute these SQL queries. I used [Oracle SQL Developer](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/sql-developer.html), which is a free, easy-to use program.
